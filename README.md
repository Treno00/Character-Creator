<h2>What is it for?</h2>
This character creator tool provides a fast and easy way to build rich, detailed characters for use as an AI character, RPG games, stories, or any other application requiring fleshed-out persona profiles. With an intuitive interface (I hope), users can quickly generate a character by selecting a pre-made personality type like "crazy", "nerd", "loyal" and more, that will automatically populate the character's traits accordingly. The tool allows for deep customization beyond the base personality types - users can add and remove specific traits to fine-tune the character to their exact vision. With just a few clicks, this tool allows anyone to breathe life into a richly-developed character profile ready for implementation in games, simulations, AI character and other applications.
